# Python Object-Oriented Programming Projects

Welcome to the Python Object-Oriented Programming Projects repository! This repository contains implementations of several object-oriented programming concepts in Python, including:

1. **Concentric Rugs**: Generate concentric rugs of various sizes.
2. **Complex Numbers**: Perform arithmetic operations on complex numbers.
3. **Fractions**: Perform arithmetic operations on fractions and simplify them.
4. **Time Conversion**: Convert time between different formats and time zones.

## Concentric Rugs

The Concentric Rugs module allows you to generate rugs with concentric patterns of varying sizes. The generated rugs are represented as nested lists, where each element represents a pixel in the rug.

## Complex Numbers

The Complex Numbers module provides functionality for performing arithmetic operations on complex numbers, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Fractions

The Fractions module enables arithmetic operations on fractions and simplifies them to their lowest terms.

## Time Conversion

The Time Conversion module provides functions for converting time between different formats and time zones.

## Menu Options

Each module provides a menu-driven interface for performing operations. Here are the menu options for each module:

- **Concentric Rugs**: N/A (Function-based)
- **Complex Numbers**: "1: combine, 2: subtraction, 3: multiply, 4: exit"
- **Fractions**: "1: combine, 2: subtraction, 3: divide, 4: multiply, 5: simplify, 6: exit"
- **Time Conversion**: "1: combine, 2: subtraction, 3: seconds to time, 4: time to seconds, 5: GMT to Teheran time, 6: exit"
