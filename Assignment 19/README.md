# PySide6 GUI Applications

This repository contains four PySide6 GUI applications developed using Python. Each application serves a different purpose and demonstrates various features of PySide6 for building interactive graphical user interfaces.

## Contents

1. **Number Guesser Game:** A simple number guessing game where the user needs to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

2. **Password Generator:** A tool for generating random passwords of varying strengths (normal, strong, or super). Users can choose the password strength and copy the generated password for use.

3. **Unit Converter:** An application for converting between different units of measurement, including weight, length, temperature, and digital size. Users can select the category of conversion and the units to convert between.
