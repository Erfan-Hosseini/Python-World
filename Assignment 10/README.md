Object-Oriented Learning Projects
This directory contains three Python scripts designed to illustrate object-oriented programming concepts through practical examples. Each script focuses on a different class:

Time: Represents time values with properties for hour, minute, and second. Includes methods for displaying the current time, working with a chronometer, and managing time zones.

Date: Manages date information, including day, month, and year. Provides methods for converting between solar and lunar calendars, as well as between solar and Gregorian calendars. Additionally, it calculates the difference between two dates.

Fraction: Implements operations for working with fractions, including division, addition, multiplication, and subtraction.
